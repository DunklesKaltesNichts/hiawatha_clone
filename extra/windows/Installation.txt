INSTALLATION OF THE HIAWATHA WEBSERVER
=======================================
Copy the directory 'Hiawatha' to a suitable location on your harddisk. The full path to this directory will be refered to as <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR> in the rest of this documentation. Run the batch file <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>\Hiawatha.bat to start the Hiawatha webserver.


INSTALLATION OF PHP
====================
To use PHP, download the PHP zip package from http://php.net/downloads.php and unzip it to C:\Program Files\PHP5\.

Optionally, run <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>\PHP5-FastCGI.bat to start PHP as a FastCGI daemon. If you installed PHP5 in another directory, edit the batch file to change the path to the PHP5 binary.


MANUAL PAGES
=============
The Hiawatha manual pages can be found in <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>/documentation.


RUNNING HIAWATHA AS A WINDOWS SERVICE
======================================
After installation of Hiawatha, open a Command Prompt, go to <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>\program and execute the following command:

cygrunsrv.exe -I hiawatha -d "Hiawatha webserver" -f "Secure and advanced webserver" -p "<HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>\program\hiawatha.exe" -a "-d"

You can now run Hiawatha as a Windows Service. Right-click on 'My Computer', select 'Manage', select 'Services and Applications',
select 'Services' and use 'Hiawatha webserver' to start and stop Hiawatha. To remove this service, run the following command:

cygrunsrv.exe -R hiawatha


TROUBLESHOOTING
================
If you experience some trouble with Hiawatha under Windows, try installing Cygwin with the packages libxml2 and libxslt. If that doesn't solve your problem, use the forum at https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/.
